**Introduction:**
-------------------

As we move on to our second project, "Rock, Paper, Scissors," you'll see that the fundamental concepts of programming continue to be at the heart of the game. It's a step forward from our first project, "Guess My Number," but everything you've learned and practiced so far will be directly applicable and crucial to completing this project.

Variables: In "Rock, Paper, Scissors," variables hold key pieces of data such as the player's choice and the computer's choice. These variables interact with one another to determine the outcome of the game.

Conditionals: The game's outcome depends entirely on a set of conditions: rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. Implementing these rules in the game requires the use of conditional statements to compare the choices and decide the winner.

Arrays: Arrays can be used to store the game options (rock, paper, and scissors). The computer's choice can then be selected randomly from this array, showcasing a different application of arrays compared to the first project.

Loops: The game can be played repeatedly, allowing for multiple rounds. This is facilitated by loops, which will enable the game to continue until the player decides to stop.

Functions: Functions in this game can handle various tasks such as taking the player's input, generating the computer's choice, comparing the choices, declaring the winner, and more. This compartmentalization of tasks within functions leads to cleaner, more organized code.

Even though "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a simple game, it offers excellent opportunities to practice and understand how these fundamental programming concepts interact in a real application. Moreover, it builds directly on what you've learned and applied in the "Guess My Number" game, reinforcing those skills and introducing a few new challenges.

As you progress through this project, we can't stress enough the importance of writing good, clean code. Even for a simple game like this, well-structured, readable, and maintainable code can significantly enhance its functionality and your understanding of it. It allows for easy debugging and future improvements, and it sets a high standard for any code you write in the future.

In conclusion, "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is more than just a game—it's a practical, hands-on lesson in the fundamental concepts of programming and a stepping stone towards more complex projects. Let's continue our programming journey with this fun and engaging project!

**Project Requirements**:  
-------------------

Before you write any code, you should "sketch" the pseudo code and make a flowchart for how you plan to do the following alterations to the game.

- Extend the game into "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard"
- Add a start screen (i.e. don't go directly to play), the user should push a button to start play.
- Do the necessary changes to support multiple languages.
- After a game, go back to the start screen, where the user can choose to play again or exit.

If you want a challenge (higher grade), try doing these things also:

- On the startup screen give 4 choices 1p, 2p(hot-seat), change language, exit
- Do the necessary changes to support 2p hot-seat play.
- Do the necessary changes to change language from the menu
- Add a splash screen.
- Use ansi escape codes to add color ([Ansi text colors](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html#colors))

Evryone: In your README file, include a section where you highlight potential challenges or limitations in your code. Reflect on what could be done differently, and areas you believe could be improved.

All your code and related files should be neatly organized in a Zip file, with the following internal structure

    module_2_rps
    ├── Program.cs
    ├── module_2_rps.csproj
    ├── module_2_rps.sln
    └── readme.md

**About assesment:**
-------------------

Assessment for this project will be based not just on feature completion, but also on your attention to detail, the cleanliness and readability of your code, and the thoughtfulness of your README file reflections. This is your opportunity to demonstrate not just what you've learned, but how you can apply it creatively and effectively in a real programming project.
